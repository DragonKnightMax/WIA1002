My name is [YOUR_NAME] with matric number, [YOUR_MATRIC_NUMBER]. I am
majoring in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence). This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling curious about taking this
subject. This is because I have not even heard what data structure actually is.

I acquired A+ for my previous Programming 1 course. It’s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get an A again for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will study smart and practise programming every day. Wish me luck!!!

It’s me again. Finally, it’s the end of the term and the DS class has finished!
I think I performed moderately in the class.
I am happy with my performance.
I learn to use data structures in my program to organize the data.
No, my target grade still remains A.
I love lab session because it gives me hands-on learning experience.
I hope there is more hands-on learning session during the course.
